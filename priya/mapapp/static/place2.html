        The river loks nice and make peaceful  sounds
        river is a natural flowing watercourse.
        usually a freshwater stream, flowing on the earth's land surface or inside caves towards another waterbody at a lower elevation.
        such as an ocean, sea, bay, lake, wetland, or another river.
        In some cases, a river flows into the ground or becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water.
        Small rivers can be referred to by names such as creek, brook, and rivulet.
