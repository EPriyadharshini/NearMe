         A place in chennai filled with colours of emotion.
         Every dawn heralds a symphony of chirping crickets and the soft hum of daily activities.
         Villagers, connected by bonds woven over generations,engage in the gentle rhythm of daily chores and shared laughter.
         The simplicity of their lives mirrors the richness found in genuine relationships and shared moments  
         making the simple village a sanctuary of contentment and undisturbed joy.
